# The optional argument 'preserve_input' specifies whether the method
# makes a working copy of the dissimilarity vector or writes temporary
# data into the existing array. If the dissimilarities are generated for
# the clustering step only and are not needed afterward, approximately
# half the memory can be saved by specifying 'preserve_input=False'. Note
# that the input array X contains unspecified values after this procedure.
# It is therefore safer to write
#
#   linkage(X, method=..., preserve_input=false)
#   X = []
#
# to make sure that the matrix X is not accessed accidentally after it has
# been used as scratch memory. (The single linkage algorithm does not
# write to the distance matrix or its copy anyway, so the 'preserve_input'
# flag has no effect in this case.)

# If X contains vector data, it must be a two-dimensional array with N
# observations in D dimensions as an (NÃ—D) array. The preserve_input
# argument is ignored in this case. The specified metric is used to
# generate pairwise distances from the input. The following two function
# calls yield the same output:
#
#   linkage(pdist(X, metric), method="...", preserve_input=False)
#   linkage(X, metric=metric, method="...")
#
# For method=:ward, the function assumes that metric = SqEuclidean() will be chosen.
